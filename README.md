# Wumpus-World-Game-Simulation
The Wumpus world is an early computer game, which was originally created by Gregory Yob in 1972. The original version, called Hunt the Wumpus, is based on a simple hide and seek mode that requires players to discover the room with gold in a world with a dangerous monster and multiple obstacles. According to the hints gained while exploring the environment, players need to sense the location of gold and avoid the danger in the meanwhile. In this project, I explored the application of propositional logic in Artificial Intelligence by implementing truth table based entailment. 
### *Code file logic.py from folder AIMA was adapted from Artificial Intelligence: Modern Approach (Third Edition) by Stuart Russel and Peter Norvig.
### *The code of project is shown below. Use command python2 main.py to run the whole code. 
### *The detail information will be recorded in file log.txt.
